## Course Description
Generative AI and foundational models including ChatGPT have ushered the world into a new era with rich new capabilities for wide-ranging application domains. With these new capabilities also comes unprecedented challenges such as privacy, safety, ethics, alignment, and decentralization. In this class, we will introduce foundations of Large Language Models (LLMs), discuss the infrastructure, tooling, and best practices for building and running applications with LLMs, and explore the risks and challenges with these technologies and how we can build towards a responsible and democratized and decentralized future with AI. In particular, this class will cover a wide-ranging topics including:
- Foundations of LLMs
- Tech stack for building LLM applications
- Sample applications domains including code generation, data science, computer security, etc.
- Autonomous agents; personalized virtual assistants
- Trustworthy LLM, including trustworthiness evaluation & benchmarks, privacy issues in LLM, attacks on LLMs such as prompt injection
- Open source & decentralization of LLM stack, including decentralized training/inference, federated learning, open source models, open source data, edge inference
- Decentralized decision making and democratized AI governance

## Enrollment and Grading
Students are strongly encouraged to have had experience and basic understanding of Machine Learning and Deep Learning before taking this class, e.g., have taken courses such as CS182, CS188, and CS189.
Graduate students should enroll in CS294-196. Undergraduate students should enroll in CS194-196.

***If you are not able to enroll in the class, please fill out the <a href="https://forms.gle/i7d4rryctc3JN4cC9">signup form</a> and we will get back to you as soon as possible.***

This is a variable-unit course.
All enrolled students are expected to participate in lectures in person.
Students enrolling in one unit are expected to submit an article that summarizes either one of the lectures or the <a href="https://rdi.berkeley.edu/events/sbcberkeley">Future of Decentralization, AI, and Computing Summit</a>.
Students enrolling in more than one units are expected to submit a lab assignment and a project instead of the article.
The project of students enrolling in 2 units should have a written report, which can be a survey in a certain area related to LLMs.
The project of students enrolling in 3 units should also have an implementation (coding) component that programmatically interacts with LLMs, and the project of students enrolling in 4 units should have a very significant implementation component with the potential for either real world impacts or intellectual contributions.
The grade breakdowns for students enrolled in different units are the following:

|                              | 1 unit | 2 units | 3/4 units |
|------------------------------|--------|---------|-----------|
| Participation                | 50%    | 20%     | 10%       |
| Article                      | 50%    |         |           |
| Lab                          |        | 20%     | 10%       |
| Project                      |        |         |           |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;*Proposal*       |        | 10%     | 10%       |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;*Milestone*      |        | 10%     | 10%       |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;*Presentation*   |        | 25%     | 25%       |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;*Report*         |        | 15%     | 15%       |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;*Implementation* |        |         | 20%       |
